              FSDG is a non-profit and non-political organization which has been
              working informally with small scale farmers since 2007. A group of
              people who are committed to taking care of environment had been
              engaging themselves for health and wellbeing of vulnerable
              population and sustainable development in a Northern and a
              Southern district of the country. Later, they formed the
              organization having approval of the proper authority of the
              Peoples Republic of Bangladesh.
